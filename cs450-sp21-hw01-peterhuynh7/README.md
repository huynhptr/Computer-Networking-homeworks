# Homework 1: Understanding Network Traffic using Wireshark

##### **Make sure to read the homework before starting.**



In this homework, we'll learn basic usage of wireshark and how to debug network
traffic with wireshark. Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer.
Wireshark consists of two parts: one is a packet capture engine powered by
[tcpdump](http://www.tcpdump.org/), and the other is a powerful and expressive
packet parsing capability that understands hundreds of different network
protocols.

## Preparing

### Needed Tools

You will need several tools to complete this assignment, all of which are
available on all major platforms.  Some of these tools may already be available
on your machine.  You are responsible for getting these tools installed.

  * [telnet](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/)
  * [wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html)
  * [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)

### Get Trace Files

Wireshark can analyze trace files recorded by others. There are several trace
files saved in the public class git repository. We will use them as example to
learn basic usage of wireshark and understand what happened when these files
were recorded. The files you will need are located in your homework
repository, in the `pcaps` directory.

## Homework Questions

### Basic HTTP

`01_http.pcap` contains several HTTP conversations. After opening this file,
answer the questions below. You don't need to know what these fields mean
(yet!), however you should be able to find them by browsing through the
different protocols being "dissected" at different layers of each packet.

Q1: List every IPv4 address involved in an HTTP conversion in this file.
For your answer, put the every IP addresses on a single line, comma separated,
without any spaces.  For example `a.a.a.a,b.b.b.b,c.c.c.c`, etc.

Q2: There are three domains that HTTP requests are made *to* in this
file.  Name any one of them.

**hints**:
  * examples of domains are `example.org` or `www.domain.net`.  IP addresses are not domains.
  * practice using filters in wireshark to better forcus in on the traffic you
    are interested in.

### Buffered Telnet

`02_telnet-cooked.pcap` is a recording of a client connecting to
a remote server with telnet.

Q3: What are the client's and server's IP addresses?  Enter them on the same
line, comma separated, with no spaces.  (E.x `client ip,server ip`)

Q4: What is the password input by the client to login?

Q5: What was the date of the last login?  **hint** enter this using the exact
same format as it appears in the telnet conversation.

Q6: List all commands run by the client after login successfully (separate them
with commas, all on one line, and in the order they were made).

**hints**:
  * there are 4 commands
  * usernames and passwords are not commands
  * do not include the paths or arguments to commands here (ie if you see the user enter
    `/bin/cat some_file.txt` in the telnet conversation, the correct answer for this
    question is `cat`, not `cat some_file.txt` or `/bin/cat`).
  * if the same command was entered more than once, enter the command each time
    it was called during the conversation, in the order it was called.

If you are interested, several funny places you can telnet to can be found
[here](http://www.telnet.org/htm/places.htm). The Star Wars asciimation is
particularly impressive.


### Unbuffered Telnet

The telnet conversation in `03_telnet-raw.pcap` is character buffered instead
of line buffered. This means that the client sends every keypress to the server,
including characters that eventually get deleted by backspace, so there might
be incorrect keypresses in the conversation.  Please answer the following
questions:

Q7: What is the user name used by the client to login?

Q8: What is the host name pinged by the client?

Q9: List all commands run by the client, in the order they were run.  Enter
them all on the same line, comma separated.

**hints**:
  * usernames and passwords are not commands
  * do not include the paths or arguments to commands here (ie if you see the user enter
    `/bin/cat some_file.txt` in the telnet conversation, the correct answer for this
    question is `cat`, not `cat some_file.txt` or `/bin/cat`).
  * if the same command was entered more than once, enter the command each time
    it was called during the conversation, in the order it was called.

### Hidden Servers

In file `04_http-garbage-connection.pcap`, there are several http and https
conversations in this file running on the usual ports (80, 8080 for http, 443
for https). There is also an http server running on a nonstandard port (ie not
80, 8080 or 443).

Q10: Find the http conversation happening on the nonstandard port and give its
IP address and port, and the HTTP path requested to that server.
Give your answer in the format `IP,PORT,PATH`.  (**hint**, the path starts with
the `/` character).

### Trace Local Network Traffic

Q11: Wireshark isn't only for reading previously captured network traffic.
You can also it to save capture traffic on your own network.

For this question, use wireshark to capture the network traffic on your
own network when requesting the URL `http://wttr.in/chicago`.  You should
fetch this from the commandline, using a tool like [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/).
**Do not** fetch the URL in your web browser, as the site will serve different
content to web browsers than other, simpler HTTP clients.

Only include the relevant HTTP traffic in the saved file.  Once you save the resulting
network traffic in a pcap file, you will need to encode the file into [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).
The name of your encoded file for submission should be `hw1.pcap.b64`.

Here are useful references for [Linux](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) and [OSX](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/base64.1.html) on encoding files into Base64 format.

## Submission

- Clone your homework repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/UICcs450/cs450-sp21-hw<homework_number>-<yourid>.git
```

- Change your directory to the root directory of the project
```sh
cd cs450-sp21-hw<homework_number>-<yourid>
```

- Write your netid to the netid file:

Note: If your email address is your_net_id@uic.edu your netid is "your_net_id"

```sh
echo "your_net_id" > netid
```


The files which will be submitted:
* `hw1.txt`: your answers to questions 1-10.  Each answer should appear on its
               own line.  Only the first 10 lines of your file will be considered.

* `hw1.pcap.b64`: the Base64 encoded version of the pcap for Q11.


- When you are ready to sumit your homework, push it back to the repository for grading

```sh
git add . 
git commit -m "<add your comment here>" 
git push origin master
```
## Grading

There are a total of **15 possible points** for this assignment.

  * **1 point** for each of the first 10 questions.
  * **3 points** for correctly capturing the HTTP traffic described in question 11.
  * **2 point** for *only* capturing the HTTP traffic described in question 11
    (ie not including any other traffic in this file).
